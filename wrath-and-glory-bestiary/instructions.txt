Use the prior existing "wrath-and-glory-creator" data and design to create a bestiary of monsters in the Wrath and Glory system. This will be a separate program, and it should have a separate folder from "wrath-and-glory-creator” titled “wrath-and-glory-bestiary”. The sections of the books that have the enemies are generally labeled “Bestiary”, and the enemy encounters are generally labeled “Threats”. There are a few features that need to be integrated, and it is critical that these are integrated correctly. 

This program will need to be an Electon-based app that will be run on Windows.

1. All descriptions and stats should be verbatim from the book. We can except page number references. I will include a reference in “references” labeled “imperial_citizen_example.pdf” so you can see the way the original book formats the information for a threat. The program should display a table for each threat that is similar to the one presented in the book. We should retain the Glossary functionality for the gameplay statistics, abilities, keywords, etc. to make it easy to view those terms when viewing a threat.

2. There should be a keyword filter.

3. There should be a threat level filter.

4. Try to integrate a function that allows the user to change the weapon for a particular threat. Any statistics should dynamically update if a different weapon is selected. For example, the Imperial Citizen is “Unarmed” by default, but they may be able to pick up a Lasgun or other weapon. An important thing to keep in mind is that the Threats’ weapons’ statistics do not necessarily match the player versions of these weapons, so we need to ensure that we’re creating a list of Threat-specific weapons and versions of weapons to choose from that does not include Players’ Wargear.

5. Each iteration, check to ensure that verbatim text is being used and that formatting is consistent.
