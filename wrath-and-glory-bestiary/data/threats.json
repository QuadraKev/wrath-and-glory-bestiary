    "description": "The unwashed trillions that form Imperial society and prop up the Emperor's war machine through sweat and blood are diverse beyond imagining, hailing from the million unique worlds that make up the Imperium. However, there are some commonalities between the downtrodden commoners: they are utterly devoted to the God-Emperor, and ignorant of anything beyond the propaganda they are fed. They labour in hazardous conditions for punishing hours, and their treacherous work has left them with missing body parts replaced with cheap augmetics.\n\nEvangeline Galdain is a typical citizen, working for 18 hours every day at a plascrete manufactorum in Hive Ultio on Gilead Primus. She lost her organic leg when an overtired co-worker fumbled with a Heavy Rock Crusher. Her eye was replaced after a blight of Rector's Rot swept through her hab block; all she can remember from the incident that broke her ocular augmetic is the smell of incense, and she refuses to repair it or check the recordings.\n\nEvangeline spends her few spare credits on holy writs of protection sold by the Ecclesiarchy, though she can barely read the High Gothic script — even so, she has noticed some disquieting errors, which she has written off as mistranslations on her part.\n\nIf an Imperial Citizen is encountered during or after their work for the day, they are more than likely Exhausted.",

Equipped with sturdy armour and deadly weaponry, these agents discipline, capture, and execute those who go against the authorities' proclamations. More often than not, Enforcers are an extension of the planetary governor's will, empowered to arrest and detain with even the flimsiest excuse.\n\nEnforcers are arrogant and believe themselves above the law. They are cunning enough to cover their corrupt activities (or their employer's), but will not hesitate to use whatever means necessary to enforce their governor's laws, bringing Shock Maul and Shotgun to bear. Without sufficient leverage they are difficult to sway from their tasks, but many have rackets on the side in case their governor suddenly turns up dead. Enforcers are usually most dangerous when directed by a commander, but if they take it upon themselves to mete out some rough justice, they can be an intimidating force on their own. Characters should certainly think before killing an Enforcer, lest they bring down the full weight of planetary law upon their heads.",

A clock in their nervous system constantly ticks down to their death, only reset through the act of killing. Some are criminals sentenced to 'death by Chrono', while others are victims of enslavement, or unfortunate debtors who give their lives to settle their account.\n\nFew escape the toll their gross augmentation takes on their sanity. Those that are able to make their peace with their new life rise to new heights of power as bodyguards and assassins. Others are warped in both mind and body: the Timekeeper of Hive Testimonium on Gilead Primus marks their kills with the precise time of death daubed on the walls above their victims, sustaining decades of life through bursts of violence.\n\nChronos are physically powerful, with augmentations such as oversized hydraulic claws, buzz-saw arms, iron lungs and piston-driven legs. Most have subdermal armour and chemically-induced resistance to pain. A Chrono's behaviour depends on how much of their humanity they retain — some protect fragile lives outside their bloody business. Others have lost themselves to a red rage, immune to reason or compassion. All of them know it is only a matter of time, and may attack allies when their precious seconds are running slim. Chrono Gladiators are a terrifying foe to throw against characters, whether fighting for their lives in a Scum Pit or hunting them down through the chaotic corridors of a Hive.",

Whilst many cut ties with their Craftworld and become Corsairs, others continue to serve their distant kin as Rangers, acting as scouts, explorers, messengers, or even assassins. These Rangers survive in a hostile galaxy by mastering fieldcraft and stealth, fostering a self-reliance born of necessity, as backup may be lightyears away.\n\nIndividual Rangers have roamed the Gilead System for centuries, sniper assassins interfering as third parties in seemingly unrelated conflicts, enacting the enigmatic will of their Craftworld's Seer Council. In recent years, squads of Rangers patrol Ul-Khari ruins as an unseen frontier guard, or perform reconnaissance on strongpoints soon to be targeted by Aeldari warhosts. In active combat, Rangers excel when attacking from cover, at long range, and against unaware targets. When the odds are not in their favour, they simply disappear into the wilderness, waiting patiently for the next opportunity to strike again.",

    "description": "Just as the Asuryani have mastered the process of transplanting an Aeldari's soul into a Spirit Stone upon their death, they have learned to install that Spirit Stone in an inanimate shell, so they can be restored to a facsimile of true life. Disturbing the slumber of the dead can only be justified in times of existential conflict, so these wraith constructs are designed to be formidable battle platforms: roughly twice the height of an Aeldari, and armoured in reinforced wraithbone. A Wraithguard no longer perceives the world as a living soul would, but their superlative combat instincts remain. These talents are further enhanced by the appalling distortion weaponry they wield in battle, designed to tear apart a body with invasive Warp energies, or cast a soul into the ruinous beyond.\n\nWraithguard are forged with a resilience most Aeldari warriors lack, and Agents equipped to handle fast-moving Asuryani may find their Blast or other anti-personnel weaponry struggles to penetrate a wraith construct's carapace. It is just as well the Asuryani only deploy Ghost Warriors in only the most dire circumstances, for low-Tier Agents are easily Annihilated by Wraithguard weaponry. However, the Spiritseers of Ul-Khari find themselves awakening their ancestors with increasing frequency in defence of their walls, but with each awakening they further risk the spirits of their beloved ancestors falling into the grasp of She-Who-Thirsts.",

Whilst the Wraithguard are stoic and still, the Wraithblades are wrathful and furious, desperate to dispatch their foes in close combat. Their ghostblades are implanted with Spirit Stones retrieved from Crone Worlds, those forsaken planets were most afflicted by the Chaotic energies of the Fall, and the souls of their occupants have endured tortures that drove them to a howling rage. Though the Spiritseers are deeply troubled by the anguish of these spirits, they are a useful asset in battle, as the Wraithblades vent their anger against the enemies of their Craftworld.\n\nWhilst Wraithguard excel at mid-range firefights, Wraithblades are melee specialists through-and-through, preferring to brutally engage groups of Agents where possible. Luckily, they can be outmanoeuvred, as they are neither fast nor as unnaturally graceful as living Aeldari. Whilst canny Agents can avoid melee by affecting a tactical retreat and firing on-the-move, the sheer resilience of the Wraithblades makes this a time-consuming strategy, allowing other Asuryani to seize unguarded strongpoints in the meantime. High-Tier Agents may stand and fight instead, but should expect to pay a price for their courage.",

The Ghostglaive is perhaps the most iconic — a blade twice the height of a man that can fell a towering monster as easily it does a whole squad of infantry.\n\nA Wraithlord is a devastating opponent for any warparty.

Noble and elegant, yet unabashadley cruel, each Archon wields the power to capture and enslave without discrimination, able to put entire planets to the sword or lash at their whim, marshalling the combined forces of the Dark City alongside vicious mercenaries to unleash incomparable terror and suffering.\n\nAs all Drukhari are vain and egotistical, craving power and influence, the Archons position is under constant threat from those beneath them. This means the Archons employ a vast retinue of the most deadly and loyal of their kin and trusted outsiders to stand vigilant by their side. Even with this protection, only the most cunning and ruthless survive to ascend to true positions of influence.\n\nHaving long feasted on the suffering to sustain their millennia long existence, the Archons must launch more and more raids into Realspace as now only the most sadistic of atrocities can breathe life back into their withered souls.",

Finding themselves laid out upon the Haemoncullis' blood-slicked slab their bodies are broken and remade into wicked instruments of violence and death by the deranged Flesh Carvers of Commorragh.\n\nThe Grotesque comes to reflect the twisted, execrable will of its creator, the madness of the Haemonculi rendered in a vile amalgamation of flesh and machine. Left with little will, they are mindlessly dedicated to their creators. These swollen monstrosities shamble morosely in a state of mindless compliance until ordered to kill by their dark masters.\n\nOnce roused the twisted form of the Grotesque is flushed with a cacophony of potent elixirs, combat stimulants and worse, sending them into a frenzied bloodlust. Unleashed, they turn their unnatural strength and mechanically augmented blades to butcher until the will of their creator is satisfied.",

Warbosses insist on being equipped with the biggest, most brutal weapons and armour available. Many wear Mega Armour, an almost unnecessary compliment to their already incredibly tough hides.

The staff acts as a release valve, letting out psychic pressure before the Weirdboy bursts. This process is horribly painful for the Weirdboy and can prove deadly for if too much energy builds before they can release it causes their head to explode. Since the gestalt vigour of the Orks builds up constantly, most Weirdboyz avoid other Orks as much as possible. This often includes during combat, and many Weirdboyz wind up dragged onto the battlefield kicking and screaming against their will. Of course, this only riles up the rest of the greenskins, which, in a vicious cycle, gives the Weirdboy more power and agitates them further.

Runtherds are a notable exception to this, capable of taking on the tiresome task of managing a warband's grots and snots.\n\nWhile the vast majority of Orks are destined for a life of fightin', it is the Runtherds that ensure a warbands continued survival. The most basic and essential tasks in Ork society, such as cultivating fungus or rearing Squigs, fall to Gretchin and Snotlings. However, neither are particularly inclined towards productivity, so it falls to the Runtherdz to squeeze some work out of them. Through painstaking effort the Runtherdz train their charges to perform the sort of tasks that any Ork could complete, but almost none want to.\n\nOf course, Runtherdz don't refrain from battle entirely — they are Orks after all. When war looms the Runtherdz gather up their favourite Grabba Stikk and prod their dimunitive charges into action. Brimming with something akin to pride, the Runtherdz arm the Gretchin they have trained, point them towards the enemy, and send them off to almost certain death.",

Their presence is seen by those informed enough to recognise them as the beginnings of an Ork infestation. Typically tended to — and sometimes fed on — Snotlings, Squigs serve a number of purposes. Some are simply eaten, a dangerous game that provides a temporary distraction for the larger Orks, while others are used as mounts or trained to accompany their masters into combat. The variety found among squigs is truly vast, and those Imperial scribes who have attempted to document it have largely given up or been driven mad.\n\nWhile Squigs are bred and raised for specific purposes, all are vicious and aggressive by nature. With rows of bladed teeth, razor sharp claws, and an insatiable hunger, herds of Squigs are often set loose upon an enemy. While they do occasionally devour their handlers in a flurry of gnashing teeth, most Orks consider either outcome highly entertaining.",

A gargantuan, shambling titan of Ork menace that spreads fear and panic alongside uncountable rounds of ammunition. These immense killing machines are built with the enthusiastic single mindedness that is unique to their Mek creators as they dedicate themselves completely to the construction of these great, battle-ready idols to their god of brutality, Gork.\n\nOutcast Nobz, excessively truculent even by the standards of Orks, pilot these lumbering war engines, following the echoing call of the Great Waaagh! out across the stars in search of the biggest and most violent engagements. They are welcomed by Ork warbands wherever they go, a creaking, war born effigy to their most belligerent of Gods. Those that face these terrifying constructs seldom live to tell of their horror, ripped asunder as the Gorkanaut unleashes punishing hails of devastating firepower, shattering bones in the grasp of their enormous, piston-powered klaws or simply crushing anything in its way under their massive steel feet.",

Dormant genetic traits take hold, as the Genestealer seeks to form its own gestalt mind and foster a growing throng of thralls. As its followers grow in number so does the Patriarch, swelling in size and developing its bestial brain into a more potent psychic mind. As the cult expands, the gestalt Brood Mind spreads like a thick fog, enveloping the minds and wills of those about it, mimicking the true Tyranid Hive Mind at a smaller scale.",

Not only are they savvy commanders, they are blessed with strength and preternatural speed, enabling such figures to fight toe-to-toe with even the superhuman Astartes.\n\nWhile a Primus is a competent fighter, they further are enhanced by their twisted wargear.

On the battlefield, vast, chittering swarms are usually deployed to cover the advance of more valuable units. Despite their small size, the mandibles of a Canoptek Scarab are capable of chewing through almost any material, and they are particularly prized for their ability to rip through heavy armour. Even the heaviest of enemy vehicles seldom has any way to defend itself against a Swarm once it is latched onto their hull. Scarabs are hard to target and can pour in through even a small gun port or glide over fortifications to envelop their prey. Scarabs are generally under the control of more complex Canopteks, and have only instinctive intelligence without being directed.",

This means that even if an attack fails to achieve a kill outright, it may still snuff out the target's personality, leaving them a mindless husk.\n\nDeathmarks are so patient and stealthy that Crypteks have postulated that there may well be many of them scattered across the galaxy who were sent on missions only for their dynasty to fall.

Despite their disposable nature Cryptothralls are well armed, and are quite fearsome in short-range or close-combat. Their forearm blades are capable of scything through armour easily, while their single large eye can project potent bolts of energy.\n\nCryptek Anephteh has been known to engage in a game similar to Regicide, but using living Cryptothralls as the 'pieces' and watching them destroy each other.",

However, if the XV8's strengths lie in its mobility, so do its weaknesses. A Shas'ui piloting their XV8 too boldly can easily find themselves outmatched when cut off from a route of retreat. XV8 operators must always ride that razor's edge to make best use of their battlesuit's capability — piloting it is a dangerous thrill.",

Fire Warrior infantry makes up the majority of most T'au armies, and every Fire Caste recruit starts out among their ranks. They are all equipped with either the standard T'au pulse rifle or carbines, powerful long-ranged weapons that can be devastatingly more effective than the Imperial equivalent standard-issue Lasgun. T'au weapons training emphasises precision. Fire Warriors prefer to mass fire from a stationary position, to pick off enemies before they can get into melee range.\n\nHolding the line requires Fire Warriors to operate in close-knit squads, where every soldier can rely on their fellows. Should even one among the squad's discipline break under fire, all may be lost. Their specialised training means Fire Warriors are less effective in close combat, where their only defence is symbolic: a Bonding Knife, which every one of them carries. This is an essential weapon but its main use lies before combat, not during. The mutual trust of all Fire Warriors is emphasised in a ritual ceremony known as Ta'lissera, where they become one blood through use of the Bonding Knife.",

To maximise the abilities of a skilled marksman, they are not themselves aiming a singular sniper rifle, but instead controlling a group of Sniper Drones.\n\nThis arrangement allows the marksman to remain at a distance from targets which effective shots would typically be impossible, by moving in their remote drones. This is made possible through some of the most sophisticated targeting sensors and drone uplinks the Earth Caste can provide outside of a battlesuit.\n\nDespite their best efforts, the resulting portable unit is still extremely bulky, all but eliminating the possibility of effective manoeuvring once a Firesight Marksman has taken up their position. Fortunately, a personal stealth field affords the marksman some protection. A skilled marksman further obscures their position by varying the angles at which their drones engage the enemy. The Firesight Marksman thus combines enormous striking potential with a flexibility not typically encountered in a sniper — at the price of extreme vulnerability should their position be discovered.",

The T'au value stealth and cunning just as much as martial skill, and even more importantly is that Pathfinder assignments are often riskier than those of the average Fire Warrior, as they must operate independently and often in close contact with the enemy. Becoming a Pathfinder is thus considered highly honourable, and a direct path to Shas'ui. Pathfinder teams are equipped with state-of-the-art encrypted communication devices, to relay their observations back to those other T'au units whose lives depend on that information.

Their AIs, too, are of strictly limited capability, as their function is straightforward: lock onto a target and destroy it. Gun drones are most commonly mounted on T'au vehicles, such as the Devilfish, from where they can be detached to support landed troops while remaining under direct control by the pilot.\n\nHowever, T'au field commanders have discovered that linking the AIs of several Gun Drones provides just enough independence for a squadron of these simple-minded automatons to lay down smart fire support in tactically critical situations. Since gun drones are so basic, they are cheap to produce and generally considered expendable. When a Fire Warrior team must leave its entrenched position, a Gun Drone squadron can be deployed to cover them — as the first to emerge, the drones draw fire and are unlikely to survive for long, but better them than a valuable team of Fire Warriors. Gun Drone squadrons are also often deployed to probe enemy positions, or harass enemy lines to soften them up in preparation for an assault.",

They would surely be worried by reports that some Pathfinders, operating isolated for weeks except for the company of a Recon Drone, converse with their MB3 as with an old friend.\n\nDue to their high cost during production, MB3's are programmed to disengage and preserve themselves when encountering overwhelming opposition. However to be able to fulfil their role effectively they are mounted with an anti-infantry burst cannon that allows them to dispatch light resistance. MB3s can relay their findings and position across vast distances, calling in T'au troops where required.",

Kroot warriors are called 'carnivores' with good reason — they feast on those fallen in battle, even if it includes their own dead. The terror instilled by this reputation is a weapon in its own right.\n\nThese groups of hunters are the most commonly encountered Kroot outside of their home-world Pech, and indeed likely the most numerous T'au auxiliaries by a wide margin. While they share a special bond of blood and honour with the T'au, by whom they are valued just as much as Fire Warriors, they are perfectly willing to serve as mercenaries for other factions.\n\nKroot Carnivores are armed with the bladed Kroot staff rifles, modelled on their traditional combat sticks. They fire this weapon competently enough, but their main strength lies in close-quarters combat. A common Kroot tactic is to stealth as close to prey as possible, and then bridge the remaining distance with a vicious charge, peppering their foes with bullets before tearing into them with blade and beak.",

It is the responsibility of the Kroot Shapers to ensure that Kroot physiology does not catastrophically deteriorate or radiate into chaotically divergent forms — which can easily result from indiscriminate gorging. Due to the deep cultural significance consuming their prey as well as their own dead has to the Kroot, this gives the shapers great military, political, and spiritual authority.\n\nShapers lead Kroot Carnivores in combat, much like T'au Shas'ui lead Fire Warriors, allowing them to seek out foes with useful physiological characteristics. The shapers direct what is consumed by whom, to produce lines that ensure the Kroot prosper — this 'shaping' is aided by their ability to sample a prey's genetic make-up. Based on this capability to 'taste' a creature's biological essence, the shapers have declared Tyranids and beings mutated by Chaos 'inedible' — a term that signifies great revulsion and taboo among the Kroot. The shapers' instinctual access to genetic information seems to go as far as to allow them to access their ancestors' genetic memory in visions, to guide them in times of crisis.",

The Kroot use them as trackers on the hunt, as the hound's senses exceed even those of the most skilled Kroot Carnivore. In addition to the hound's keen eyesight, their entire spine ridge is covered in quills studded with sensory apparatus. By raising these quills up, Kroot Hounds can feel the vibrations in the air that herald the movement of their prey. They can sample a wide range of molecules wafting on the wind, far in excess of what any ordinary sense of smell could detect. Once they know their target's location, they tug their quills in tight to produce a sleek shape, ideal for the pursuit.\n\nWhile highly intelligent, and able to follow complex commands, it is also clear why the shapers consider the Kroot Hound a dead end: they are irascible and difficult to control — even experienced handlers have been killed by hounds they raised from pups. The Kroot thus often allow hounds to roam free in war, unleashing their instincts on the enemy without the danger of handling them directly.",

The herders ride their beast into combat, with a heavy cannon mounted on its back. In many ways, the Krootox thus fulfils the roles of a biological tank, and its thick hide is almost as well armoured.\n\nDue to their limited intelligence and simple, brutish nature, Krootox are thankfully easy to control.

    "description": "The staple force of the Vespids in T'au war complements, Stingwings are highly mobile, by virtue of their hyper-sonic beating wings. They are deployed in support of T'au units who can keep up with them, such as Crisis Battlesuits, or those in desperate need of mobile anti-armor firepower, such as Pathfinder teams. The Vespid's signature weapon is the neutron blaster, based on their unique crystal technology and blended with T'au ingenuity. This exotic weapon literally strips atoms off its target and while it may slow-acting, its effect is reliable and constant, and neither ceramite nor flesh can withstand it. The neutron blaster is surprisingly light for a weapon with such devastating effect, but can only be operated by Vespid, due to the constant harmonic feedback modulation the crystals require.\n\nA distinct and severe potential difficulty with Stingwings employed in the service of the T'au is the complete and utter impossibility of direct communication with them. Only Vespid Strain Leaders are equipped with the rare Vespid communion helmets, which facilitates understanding. Vespid Stingwings who become isolated from their strain leader can become very confused and, worryingly, even hostile to their allies.",
